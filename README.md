# Black-Scholes_formula
# Option Pricing and Portfolio Risk Assessment

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and Colab notebooks for pricing financial options using the Black-Scholes-Merton model and assessing the risk of a financial portfolio. The scripts demonstrate the computation of European option prices, option greeks, portfolio values, and Value at Risk (VaR) calculations.

## Contents
- `OptionPricing.ipynb`: A Colab notebook illustrating the use of the Black-Scholes-Merton model to price European call and put options, including the calculation of the greeks.
- `PortfolioRisk.ipynb`: A Colab notebook demonstrating the assessment of portfolio risk through the computation of portfolio values and VaR.
- `UtilScripts.py`: Utility scripts containing functions for option pricing and risk assessment used in the notebooks.

## Features
- Calculation of option prices using the Black-Scholes-Merton model.
- Assessment of option sensitivities (greeks) to underlying parameters.
- Portfolio value estimation based on asset holdings and market prices.
- VaR computation for risk management purposes.

## Usage
To use these scripts, you will need to have access to Python 3 and the following packages: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and pandas. You can run the Colab notebooks directly in the browser with Google Colab.
